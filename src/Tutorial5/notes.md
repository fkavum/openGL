## Vertex Attributes and Layouts

- We have to tell OpenGL that, what is in the memory and how its laid out,
- For the shader side you need to math the layout that you define in the CPU side.
- Vertex is more than position... (texture coordinates, normals, colors, byNormals, tangents etc.)
- Each vertex type is attribute, color is attribute, normals is attribute etc.
