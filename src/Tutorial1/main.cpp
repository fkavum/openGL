 ## Welcome to OpenGL
 OpenGL by it self is just a spesification, its not a code or anything.
 What it is is a specification that lists: hey this
 function should exist should take this paramaters that should return this value...

 Where can I download:
 who implements it: your gpu manifacture. Your manifacturer implementation differs.
 When you call OpenGL function, its called by your manifacturer.
 You dont really download it...


They say its open source but you can really see it. Because its written by your manifacturer.
 Soo, you cant see driver source code means you cant see it.

its kinda crossPlatform...
But gameengines not one graphics api...

 Legacy opengl -> easy to use but not much control there is a lot of presets
 Modern opengl -> Main difference between legacy and modern is programmable Shaders
    For example light calculations used to be calculated in CPU in legacy openGL
